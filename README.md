## Organization
Please read [Organization.md](Organization.md)

## Resources

The images are on a sprite sheet called "SolitaireCards.png". This is in a resource folder called "res". You'll have to set you IDE to use this as a resource folder if your classpath does not automatically find it.  (.gitignore ignores .project and .classpath files)
